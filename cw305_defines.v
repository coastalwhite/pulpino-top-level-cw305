// *** WARNING***  
// Two identical copies are maintained in this repo: 
// - one in software/chipwhisperer/capture/targets/defines/, used by CW305.py at runtime
// - one in hardware/victims/cw305_artixtarget/fpga/common/, used by Vivado when building the bitfile
// Ideally we could use a symlink but that doesn't work on Windows. There are solutions to that 
// (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5917249/git-symlinks-in-windows) but they have their own risks.
// Since this is the only symlink candidate in this repo at this moment, it seems easier/less risky
// to deal with having two files.
